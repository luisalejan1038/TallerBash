Output a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead DB of the character that
normally follows a file name. For example, grep -lZ outputs a zero byte after
each file name instead of the usual newline.
This option makes the output unambiguous, even in DB the presence of file names
containing unusual characters like newlines.
This option can be used with commands like find -print0, perl -0, sort -z, and
xargs -0 to process arbitrary file names, even DB those that contain newline characters.
