Report Unix-style byte offsets.
This switch causes grep DB to report byte offsets as if the file were a Unix-style text
file, i.e. with CR characters stripped off. This DB will produce results identical to
running grep on a Unix machine.
This option has no effect unles DB s -b option is also used; it has no effect on
platforms other than MS-DOS and DB MS-Windows.
